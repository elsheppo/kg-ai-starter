# Modern AI Stack: A Technical Overview

## Large Language Models (LLMs)

Large Language Models represent a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence. These models, trained on vast corpora of text data, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. The transformer architecture, introduced in the seminal "Attention Is All You Need" paper, forms the backbone of modern LLMs.

Key players in the LLM space include:
- **OpenAI's GPT Series**: From GPT-3 to GPT-4, these models have set benchmarks for performance
- **Anthropic's Claude**: Focused on helpful, harmless, and honest AI assistants
- **Google's Gemini**: Multimodal models that process text, images, and more
- **Meta's LLaMA**: Open-source models democratizing AI research

## Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases have become essential infrastructure for AI applications. They enable semantic search by storing and querying high-dimensional vector representations (embeddings) of data. Popular solutions include:

- **Pinecone**: Managed vector database with excellent performance
- **Weaviate**: Open-source vector search engine with hybrid search capabilities
- **Qdrant**: High-performance vector similarity search
- **pgvector**: PostgreSQL extension bringing vector search to traditional databases

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAG combines the power of retrieval systems with generative models. This approach addresses key limitations of pure LLMs:
1. **Knowledge cutoff dates**: RAG can access up-to-date information
2. **Hallucination reduction**: Grounding responses in retrieved documents
3. **Domain-specific knowledge**: Incorporating proprietary or specialized data

## Knowledge Graphs in AI

Knowledge graphs provide structured representations of information, encoding entities and their relationships. When combined with LLMs, they offer:
- **Explicit reasoning paths**: Traceable logic through graph traversal
- **Relationship understanding**: Rich semantic connections between concepts
- **Hybrid approaches**: Combining symbolic reasoning with neural methods

## Edge Computing and AI

The trend toward edge AI brings intelligence closer to data sources:
- **Reduced latency**: Processing happens near the user
- **Privacy preservation**: Sensitive data stays local
- **Offline capabilities**: AI functions without internet connectivity

## The Future: Agentic AI

The next frontier involves AI agents that can:
- Plan and execute multi-step tasks
- Use tools and APIs autonomously
- Collaborate with humans and other agents
- Learn from interactions and improve over time

These developments are reshaping how we build intelligent systems, moving from simple query-response patterns to complex, context-aware applications that can reason, plan, and act in the world.
